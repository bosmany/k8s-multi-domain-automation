 Multi-Tenant Setup (Hosting Multiple Domains)
Host multiple domains on the same cluster (e.g., app1.com and app2.com).
Use specific Ingress rules for each domain.
=================
Example:
app1.test.example.com -> Backend service: app1-service
app2.test.example.com -> Backend service: app2-service
=================
We'll configure the following:

Host multiple domains or subdomains.
Create separate backend services for each domain.
Update the Ingress resource with rules for domain-specific routing.
